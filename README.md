This is a complete basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that I developed independently to reinforce the concepts I learned while creating my other application, Alpha Blog.

With this app, users can conveniently store their friends' contact information in a user-friendly format. Additionally, I am actively working to enhance the app's user interface by eliminating the dependency on Bootstrap and instead utilizing customized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
